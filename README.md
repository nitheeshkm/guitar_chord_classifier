Chord Classifier
This project deals with designing a guitar chord classifier. The input is a digitally sampled microphone
signal of different guitars playing chords. The goal of the project is to process the signal and detect the
chord.


The input is captured with the phoneâ€™s microphone and is sampled at 16,000 Hz. The goal is to process N samples of audio data and
output the chord estimate as quickly and accurately as possible.
